## How to install:
Simply run `npm install` or `yarn` command and then use `yarn start` or `npm run start`. Easy, right?

### How to use json-server:
Json-server is a great package that allows us get data from external sources (like .json files)
without setting up the actual backend.
1) Run `json-server --watch PATH_TO_YOUR_JSON --port PORT` command
2) Change the port in the proxy field with the one you used in the previous command.
   You can find proxy field in the package.json file
3) Start your React app. Or restart if it is already has been started.
#### Keep in mind that the app is using /test route for json-server by default so change it before using in case you want other route name. You can change it in Main.tsx file

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `json-server --watch your_file.json --port PORT`
This project comes with [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), which can be used as
a temporary backend. Visit the link above for more information.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn lint`

Lints and fixes files.
